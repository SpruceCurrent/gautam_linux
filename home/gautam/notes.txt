Additional softwares after a fresh Linux installation:

    super-boot-manager (http://www.sourceslist.eu/projects/super-boot-manager)
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ingalex/super-boot-manager
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install super-boot-manager

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extra characters (e.g. German umlauts, rupee sign, euro sign etc.)
------------------------------------------------------------------
    Linux Mint -> Preferences -> Region & Language -> Layouts -> Options
    under "Compose key position", choose a compose key (maybe right Alt)
    open a text editor and test "Compose Key + s" followed by "s", and see if ÃŸ appears
    to change key bindings, edit the .XCompose file in the home directory

To cut the last field (using space as delimiter):
    awk -F" " '{print $NF}'
        OR
    rev | cut -d" " -f1 | rev

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get the sizes of files (without an overwhelming amount of output), use:
    du -ckhs *
    (I don't yet know the reason for the 'k', as 'du -chs *' seems to give the same output)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The output of 'echo' can be controlled by using certain "Terminfo Capabilities", e.g:
    prompt$> tput smso; echo "hello world"; tput rmso
(more here: http://tldp.org/LDP/lpg/node126.html)

To run a command at startup, there are 2 options:
    1. sudo crontab -e
       add the following in the end:
           @reboot <<command_to_run>>
      OR
    2. create a script file with your command
       make the script executable
       sudo /etc/rc.local
       path to your script at the end just above exit 0
So what's the difference?
    For the most part they're equivalent. The part where they differ is precisely when they run the
    command. /etc/rc.local is the last item to run, after all the other services have started.
    I don't yet know when @reboot runs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git diff             --> compares working copy with staged copy
git diff --staged    --> compares staged copy with last committed changes

(so if all changes have been staged, 'git diff' will give no output)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to make wireshark run as root when launched from the main menu:
system -> preferences -> main menu
find wireshark's launcher
change it to "gksudo wireshark"
